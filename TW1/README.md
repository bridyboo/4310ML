Sales and TV have a linear correlation whilst radio-sales and newspaper-sales show no correlation whatsoever.

the closer to 1.0 the correlation between the x and y-axis means they are closer to having a direct or linear correlation while the close it is to 0 it would show no correlation like newspaper-sales. -1.0 is an inverse correlation although in our test case we did not find one.
