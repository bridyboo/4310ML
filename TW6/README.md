Summary of what we learned:

The most obvious change that we noticed was the difference in Lasso Regression. Initially, we tried it on the “Breast Cancer dataset” and was surprised to find a lot of zeros and negative zeroes. We also tried lasso regression on the random synthetic dataset and it returned to us actual useful values (R-squared score (training): 0.650 R-squared scores (test): 0.545) The purpose of applying lasso regression is to simplify the model by eliminating coefficient values that are close to zero. The results from the synthetic dataset imply the amount of “noise” that was in the dataset. While the breast cancer dataset (a hand-picked dataset) looks to be very “clean” in comparison.
