Summary: 
ReportThe accuracy of all the models for the Decision Trees, Naive Bayes Classifier, and KNN were all very low with all of them hovering around 50-60% accuracy. However, the performance of the models when used on our data set is irrelevant because our dataset does not have its own classifiers. I believe that part of the problem with the accuracy of the models is that we had to assign the dataset its own classifiers before we could attempt to train a model to classify the data. Thus possibly handicapping its future accuracy by making the classifier based on a simple buy or sell classification system. To improve the models, we should find a dataset with pre-determined classifications that are based on previous data and the actions of stockholders. For our dataset, a better way to create models for it would be to use a regression model to find a trendline for the data.
