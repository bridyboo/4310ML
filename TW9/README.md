Summary: 

Through our analysis of Neural Network algorithms we found that for the range of numbers given the size of the hidden layers didnâ€™t affect the accuracy of the resulting model in a meaningful way. By far the largest effect on the accuracy of the model was the scaling of the data. The models trained with unscaled data were much less accurate than those that used scaled data. This was also seen with our usage of scaled data in DAP5, our model was useless before scaling but became extremely accurate after scaling.
