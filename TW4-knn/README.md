Summary:

Part 1: It showed that there is no difference in changing k = 5, 4, 3, and 2, since they all equal to 0.5333... However, when k = 1, it results in much better, 0.6. (It later showed on the graph.) So, we chose k = 1 model to the our cross validation in Part 2.

 Part 2: In 3 fold-cross-validation, the accuracy of the model on the test set came out to 0.60. The accuracy of the knn classifier after 3-cross validation  matches with the mean accuracy of the knn classifier when k=1.
